# Jobamate
Welcome to Jobamate, a specialized job portal designed to cater to individuals with disabilities. This application serves as a beacon of inclusivity and opportunity, offering a platform where talents and companies converge to foster a diverse and empowered workforce.
Our primary objective is to empower people with disabilities in Indonesia by providing them with equal opportunities for sustainable and gainful employment. This application will serve as a bridge connecting job seekers with disabilities to employers who value diversity and inclusion.
By facilitating connections between job seekers and employers, fostering skill development, and promoting inclusive work environments, we aspire to create a more equitable society where everyone has a chance to thrive.

# Introduction
Jobamate is the culmination of the collective efforts of the 2023 cohort at Bangkit Academy. As our capstone project, we aimed not only to create a functional application but to address a critical need in society by bridging the gap between job seekers with disabilities and supportive employers.
